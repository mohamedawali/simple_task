# simpletask

This repository contains the source code for [simpletask], a Flutter mobile application.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application on a physical device, ensure that you have the following installed:

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart)

Connect your physical device (Android or iOS) to your computer using a USB cable and enable USB debugging on your device.

## Running on a Physical Device

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the Flutter project using the following command:

    bash
    cd path/to/your/flutter/project
    

2. Ensure that your device is connected and recognized by Flutter. Run the following command:

    bash
    flutter devices
    

   Make sure your device is listed as a connected device.

3. Build and install the Flutter app on your connected device using the following command:

    bash
    flutter run
    

   Flutter will compile your app, install it on the connected device, and automatically launch the app.

4. After the app is running, you can make changes to your Flutter code. Save the changes, and Flutter's hot reload feature will automatically update the running app without restarting it.

## Additional Notes

- If you encounter any issues, refer to the [Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs) for troubleshooting and support.

- For iOS development, ensure you have Xcode installed on a macOS system.
- For Android development, ensure you have vs code or AndroidStudio installed on a windows system.
- For Android development, make sure to enable USB debugging on your Android device.

Happy coding!
